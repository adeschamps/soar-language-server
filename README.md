# Soar Language Server

This project provides editor/IDE support for the [Soar
language](https://soar.eecs.umich.edu/) via the [Language Server
Protocol](https://langserver.org/).

## Features
* **Multiple IDE Support**: VSCode is the gold standard, and it has also been heavily tested in Emacs. Other IDEs that have been tried include Intellij, Eclipse, and Sublime; it works to varying degrees in these IDEs, depending on the completeness of their generic LSP support plugins.
* **Tcl Expansion**: The LSP will create a file (by default, `~tcl-expansion.soar`) that will show the Soar rules generated by any selected top level command that generates them (e.g., `sp` or other custom procs). "Selected" means the cursor is in the command or its arguments.
* **Go to Definition**: For Tcl variables and procs. Depending on your IDE and OS, this can be activated via Ctrl+left-click, right-click context menu, and/or F12.
* **Hover for Tcl Variable Values**: Hovering over a Tcl variable will show the value that variables has at that point in the code.
* **Hover for Tcl Proc Documentation**: Hovering over a Tcl proc call will show the comments immediately preceding its definition.
* **Error and Warning Reporting**: All code is actually executed in an internal JSoar instance. If this produces any errors or warnings, these are captured and displayed within the IDE. Currently the location is not very precise (e.g., it will highlight an entire rule, not the part of the rule causing a problem). The IDE attempts to continue past errors so that the analysis is as complete as possible.
* **Rename**: Tcl variables can be renamed, and the known instances are all updated.
* **Commenting selected text**: The current line or selected block can be commented/uncommented via Ctrl+/. This may vary depending on IDE and OS.
* **Autocomplete**: A list of Tcl procs will be shown when typing top-level commands or `[`. A list of Tcl variables is shown after typing a `$`.
* **Code Folding**: Comments, rules, and Tcl procs can be folded.

**A note on syntax highlighting**: This is not actually a built-in feature (it is not directly supported by LSP), but some IDEs already have plugins that provide Soar syntax highlighting. The VSCode plugin automatically includes the other existing VSCode plugin for you. Otherwise, you should use another existing plugin.

## Project Setup
In order for the Soar LSP to know how to load your agent, you need to create a `soarAgents.json` file at the root of your workspace. This file defines the agents that are present in the workspace, and which one to use as the default. A default is needed because there is currently no way to resolve conflicts for things like "Go to Definition" when two different agents define the same variable. (Note that currently only the default agent is actually analyzed.)

Here's an example:

```json
{
	"entryPoints": [
		{
			"path": "agent1/load.soar",
			"name": "agent1"
		},
		{
			"path": "agent2/load.soar",
			"name": "agent2"
		}
	],
	"active": "agent1"
}

```

The `entryPoints` list defines the name and start file for each agent. There should be at least one entry in here. The `active` field is the name of the agent to use as the default. This should match the name of one of the entries in the `entryPoint` list.

If you modify this file, you may have to restart the LSP server (e.g., re-open your workspace or restart your IDE).

# Running

Download the latest build of the server from the [releases
page](./releases), then find instructions for your editor in the
[integrations](./integrations) pages.

# Building

First, clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/soartech/soar-language-server
$ cd soar-language-server
```

We currently rely on a fork of JSoar which we include as a git
submodule, which must be initialized like so:

```bash
# The first time you clone this repository:
$ git submodule update --init

# If you pull changes that move JSoar to a new commit:
$ git submodule update
```

After the initial setup, the language server can be built with
Gradle. The Gradle wrapper script is included:

```bash
$ ./gradlew test
$ ./gradlew installDist
```

This will create an executable at
`./build/install/soar-language-server/bin/soar-language-server`.

Before pushing changes, please run the Google Java formatter:

```bash
$ ./gradlew googleJavaFormat
```

# Clients

We don't yet have any officially supported plugins. Work in progress
plugins can be found in the [integrations](./integrations) directory.
